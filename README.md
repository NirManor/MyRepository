This project handle classification of the built in Iris flower data set, form the SKlearn library.
The data set is arranged in a table and allows easy access to the information stored in it.
Through Machine learning library SKlearn, it is relatively easy to analyze the information and predict results at a fairly accurate level.
In this project I focused on two types of machine learning, from the SKlearn library:
1) Logistic Regression
2) K Neighbors classifier-KNN

I choosed to Splite the dataset into two pieces: a training set-60 % and a testing set-40 %.
The random state was set to a fixed value - 4, in order to get a fixed result for the same parameters each time I run the program.

************Conclusions************

- Logistic Regression:
  accuracy score of  96.67%

- K Neighbors classifier:
  For KNN algorithm, I test the prediction accuracy for diffrent value K - neighbors, in order to find the optimum K value.
  After tuning the K value I got quite accurate prediction accuracy of 98.3%.

- For both algorithm the prediction, the prediction accuracy for the Setosa Iris flower was 100%.

**** To run the whole application, it required to install the Yellow Brick library
